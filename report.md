## Non-technical Executive Summary

### Introduction

In this report, we investigate how Brexit has impacted citizens in the United Kingdom as well as immigrants from various regions. More specifically, we set out to answer three questions:

•	How has Brexit affected the flow of people into the UK?

•	Which nationalities were affected the most?

•	How has the availability of jobs been changed by Brexit?

#### How has Brexit affected the flow of people into the UK?

The large number of citizenship applications reflect the level of sentiment of people who wish to immigrate to the UK. The immigration numbers for various regions are shown in the figure below.

Figure 1 shows a generally decreasing trend in immigration data from 2008 to 2018. The number of American and Middle Eastern immigrants have been mostly constant, and have been relatively unaffected by Brexit (represented by the dotted line in the figure). Conversely, the Asian and African immigration rates have decreased steadily since Brexit. However, this decreasing trend dates back to 2013, which can be linked to Theresa May's aggressive stance on immigration in 2013 during her stint as Home Office Secretary. In that regard, Brexit has not had much impact on Asian and African immigration numbers.

The most illuminating trend was that of European immigration numbers. Surprisingly, immigrations numbers increased since Brexit in 2016, breaking a general downward trend since 2013. A potential factor is the increased uncertainty faced by Europeans working and living in the UK, and the introduction of the EU Settlement Scheme, which accelerated the process for citizenship applications.

The  still scope for investigation down this path, as we have not yet considered earnings on an industry-specific basis.

#### Which nationalities were affected the most?

As mentioned in the previous section, European immigrations into the UK increased sharply after Brexit. To dissect this trend, we decided to take a more regional view of Europe, segregating the immigration numbers by countries. The chloropleth above depicts the difference in immigration numbers since Brexit (2016), and a darker colour shows a greater increase, whilst a lighter colour shows a decrease. Here, we see that Polish, Italians, Germans and Romanians make up the largest group of immigrants whilst Turkey saw the largest decrease. We can therefore conclude that the Polish, Italians, Germans, and Romanians were the most affected in Europe, as expected as these do indeed make up the top ten foreign nationalities in UK.

#### How has the availability of jobs been changed by Brexit?
